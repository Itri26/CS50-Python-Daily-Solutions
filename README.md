# 🐍 CS50-Python-Daily-Solutions

Dedicated repository for daily coding practice and solutions related to foundational **Computer Science and Programming using Python**.

This daily practice supports my full-time, intensive self-study plan to master core **CS fundamentals (OSSU/DSA)** and launch a career as a Software Engineer in **2026**.

## 🎯 Current Focus

* **Course:** Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python
    *(Mapping to the fundamental requirements in the OSSU Intro CS and early Core Programming requirements).*
* **Goal:** Solidify Python proficiency, understand core programming concepts (Data Structures, Algorithms), and build consistent coding habits.
* **Method:** Daily commits showcasing small programs, exercises, and problem sets using Python.

## 📈 Activity Log
