# Finger Exercise 2
# Assume you are given a variable named number (has a numerical value). Write a piece of Python code that prints out one of the following strings: 
# positive if the variable number is positive
# negative if the variable number is negative
# zero if the variable number is equal to zero

number = 26

if number > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif number < 0 :
    print("Negative")
else:
    print("Equal to zero")
